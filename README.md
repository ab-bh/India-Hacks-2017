>Implementations of ML techniques and Neural Net to predict the direction of the road sign based on the numerical data collected from the cameras mounted on the vehicle in Front, Left, Rear, Right directions.

 >> Use of comparative analaysis and hyperparameter tuning over few classifier algorithms to achieve a multinomial logloss of 0.017<br>
>>Implementation using Keras Framework to analyse the same problem with a 4 Layer Dense Neural Net.
